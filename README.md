# iNotes

Free your notes on books from the clutches of Apple's iBooks.    
iNotes creates a markdown file, properly formatted, with the notes that you have made in the OSX version of iBooks.    
iBooks stores the notes in an sqlite DB. We sneak in and free the notes.

Once imported into Ulysses, the fantastic writing app for OSX
